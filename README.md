# Apple Developer Academy Nano Challenge 3

This is a Nano project where each student was supposed to build a simple app to present one colleague. It is a Swif project with some Collection Views and Data Structures. My team was one of the top voted among the group that we presented. It was built to run on iPhone 8.
